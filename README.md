# Boiler Room Touch Panel — v0.9.0

Standalone GUITION JC4880P443C_I_W / ESP32-P4 + ESP32-C6, 480×800 LVGL panel. [Russian documentation](README_RU.md).

## v0.9.0

The home fuel tile contains a canister with a small temperature above it. The separate bottom fuel-level button is removed. Unknown/stale inputs do not appear as a full tank. With the configured NC mapping: both contacts open = full; upper closed only = half; both closed = empty with an exclamation mark.

Pairing now starts from the web **Pair** button. A one-use six-digit code appears on the physical panel, to the left of the clock. A successful submission, cancellation or a two-minute timeout clears the code. The display wakes for the request. The physical Web access menu is removed. Codes are never returned by HTTP/MQTT; session access lasts one hour. Requests are origin-checked, ticket-bound and rate-limited; failed guesses are bounded.

The self-contained web UI has four primary sections and nested settings, grouped equipment, a canister, collapsible diagnostics and retained safety confirmations. No external fonts/CDN or cloud dependency. HTTP and MQTT are **unencrypted trusted-LAN-only** in this version.

## Installation and release discipline

The current task is preparing and installing v0.9.0; the preceding verified installation is v0.8.0. The final hardware record is `docs/verification/installed.json`. Target compilation and native/browser tests are not a claim of physical touch/sensor/MQTT verification.

Every requested successful device update must also publish its source into **main**, a matching version tag, a GitHub Release with the checked installation ZIP and SHA-256, updated README/CHANGELOG and handoff. Documentation-only updates while main stays on older firmware do not satisfy this rule. [Release process](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS_RU.md).

[Pairing and design](docs/web-v090/README.md) · [Home Assistant](docs/home-assistant.md) · [safe COM3 flash](docs/flash-panel.md) · [handoff](docs/CHAT_HANDOFF_RU.md) · [AGENTS](AGENTS.md).

No physical actuator commands are implemented. Real sensors are still unconnected/unverified. MQTT sensor-source import and Modbus adapters are not active. Legacy general CI issue #15 remains separate from successful dedicated checks.
